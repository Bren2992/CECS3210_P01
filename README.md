This program was made as part of the Advance Programming Class. I chose to do a dice program with the graphic.py and random library.
I used as a source code the following program that I found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15651521/dice-roll-in-python-gui
This program gave me an idea of how to make the dices dots and how to make the algorithm logic for the random part.

I had to change the Points coordenates, because the ones in the code were not working properly. I made a sketch of how the coordenates in the source code were working, but I'm learning to use this platform and I don't know yet how to add the picture.
Also, I changed the random dice logic, because the dots were unorganized in the GUI. 
I added two functions one that prints a message of the game and rules. And the other ask for the user input, to take a guess on which dice number will be generated.

For future work I want to make a loop where the program evaluates if the user guess the right number and tells if he won the game or not.
Anybody that wants to collaborate or give me a new idea, feel free to write to me.
